How to use google?
Insight:  The searching result ofen is coming form some specified websites: like stackoverflow for coding problems, stackexchange for engineering problems, vim for plugin information...   

<!--more-->

I try to write python importing the selenium to search keywords in specified websites. But I found some interesting things on Google Search.

So let's redesign the problem:
1.  Originally, the problem is: Can we redesign the desplay way of the searching workflow and the search result view?

Talk with my workmate Yu Wang. I should reclaim the problem:
2.  How to improve the searching result in Google Search?

Sure, these two are quite different problems. For now, I think I should learn No.2 first. To figure out what the capability of Google Search is.

Other Search Engine:
[Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/): Try it for searching some daily affairs.


So the capabilities of [Google Search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) are:
1.  Tell you what's wrong with the search expression(I use search expression to instead of the keywords, as the search expression is more powerful)   
Pros:   ignore invalid character, help you to make keywords precision.    

2.  site:google.com, only search in the domain area.
Pros:   Search specified site, you don't need try to think out some tech words for the questions.

3.  link:google.com, search websites link to the domain name.
Pros:   Help you to find some Summarization Website or Blogs.

4.  related:stackoverflow.com
Pros:   Find some substitutes of the website used.
FUN:    I find [netvibes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netvibes) to try

5.  OR check one of the two keywords
Pros:   Sometime, not sure which words is the best way to approach the problem

6.  "google.com", check URLS contains the term "google.com"
Pros:   Find some interesting functionality provided by the host.

7.  cache:website.com, see the google cache of the website
Pros:   Some times, only cache contains some useful information.

8.  -: minus, - excludes the results that include the word or site.
Pros:   useful for some words with multiple meanings
